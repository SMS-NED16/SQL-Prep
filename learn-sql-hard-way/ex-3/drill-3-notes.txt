DRILL 1 - INSERTING MYSELF AND MY PETS INTO THE DB
1. It's a pain to keep track of the primary key when inserting values into the database. If the primary key is not unique, the INSERT VALUES operation fails. 

2. This is especially frustrating if some, but not all, INSERT queries in a script fails due to a syntax or other error. Those values will already have been inserted into the DB table with the appropriate key, which means when I fix the mistake and run the INSERT VALUES script again, I get a primary key error because the script is trying to insert values with the same primary key as previously inserted data.

3. The only workaround I've been able to figure out so far is to remove the database entirely with rm -rf *.db and then repopulate it. This will have to do until I learn UPDATE or DELETE.

DRILL 2 - NEW DB WITH SAME SCHEMA AS EX 2
Did not modify the original database. Used the same script to create it. So no need to do this drill.


DRILL 3
- I learned that SQLite has very few basic data types: NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, and BLOB. BLOB is the most interesting: it's like a generic data type that stores data exactly as it was input. 
- I learned that SQLite supports a concept called Type Affinity, which means any column can technically store any type of data but still has a preferred type. For instance, a TEXT affinity column will store data using NULL, TEXT, or BLOB. 
- NUMERIC affinity means it stores all fives classe.
- REAL or INTEGER affinity has implications for casting.
- NONE affinity means no typecasting will be done to try and convert data from the input/parsed type to the affinity type.
- Ways of writing text
	- CHARACTER(20)
	- VARCHARACTER(255)
	- VARYINGCHARACTER(255)
	- NCHAR(55)
	- NATIVE CHARACTER(70)
- Ways of writing INTEGER
	- INT
	- INTEGER
	- TINYINT
	- SMALLINT
	- MEDIUMINT
	- BIGINT
	- UNSIGNED BIG INT
	- INT2
	- INT8
- Ways of writing REAL
	- REAL
	- DOUBLE
	- DOUBLE PRECISION
	- FLOAT
- Ways of writing NUMERIC
	- NUMERIC
	- DECIMAL(10, 5) // precision and base?
	- BOOLEAN
	- DATE
	- DATETIME
- I learned that data and time are stored as TEXT, REAL, OR INTEGER values.
- I learned that boolean values are stored as INT 1 OR 0.
