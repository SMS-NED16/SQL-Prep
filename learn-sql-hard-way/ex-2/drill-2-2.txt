Yes, it is possible to put more than one row into person_pet. Neither the person_id nor the pet_id is designated as a primary or secondary key in the table's schema. This means that we need not limit ourselves to one row per person_id. In other words, if a single person_id has multiple pet_ids associated with it, we would just make a new row with the same person_id and different pet_id for each pet that person owns.
